# minecraftTileGame
A Minecraft styled tile-based game using Java Processing. 

The goal of this game is to reach the end of the map without dying. 

Steve, the main player, goes through the map avoiding mob enemies 
and the obstacles, such as bedrock and lava. 

Steve must collect a number of diamonds to pass through the blocked 
passages. As Steve passes each passage, the number of diamonds 
required increases. 

There are tokens such as steak, carrot, and horses than help Steve
with his journey. Steaks and carrots increase his health while 
horses speed him up for a bit. 

There are sound effects to make the game even more engaging! 

Have fun and good luck!
